# Effective Python

## Chapter 1. Python Thinking


```python
import this

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

import this를 입력 하면 나오는 Python의 철학.

### BETTER WAY 1. 사용 중인 파이썬의 버전을 알자

```python
$python --version

or

import sys
print(sys.version_info)
print(sys.version
```

Python2의 경우, 새로운 기능이 추가되고 있지 않고 버그 수정 등의 유지보수만 진행 중.  
Python3을 사용할 것을 추천!

파이썬에는 CPython, Jython, IronPython, PyPy 등의 다양한 런타임이 존재.

### BETTER WAY 2. PEP 8 스타일 가이드를 따르자

PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal)#8 : Python Style Guide
